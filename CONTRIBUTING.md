# Contributing to lifelong learning and digital literacy
How to start your contributing to this project? Any support is welcome! Increasing our network is already helpful, also reading our texts and check if it is easy to understand will benefit. It would be great if you can share examples of projects that also work on increasing digital literacy of adults. Or when you have researches or tools that support, it would be great for us to see and/try them ourselves. Another way to support is completing this questionnaire.

# Lifelong-learning-and-digital-literacy

Hello! Welcome to our project ‘increasing digital literacy of youth workers’. My name is Sandra van de Kraak and I’m working as an international youth worker and a trainer in the field of youth. As youth worker I like to play and often this doesn’t mean playing online and using online tools, but creating non-formal activities to teach other youth workers. I’m here in Github and in the Global Sprint to learn to work more open online and to understand how other sectors work. If you want to support youth workers as myself to learn how to connect better online, show ways how to work open, that would be great. As youth worker I have an ok knowledge and understanding of using the internet, but for sure not the competences that a ICT expert has. Together we can do great things.

In my daily work I'm working together with youth workers to build their digital literacy and lifelong learning attitude so that they can include digital tools in their work with young people during outside school activities.

What this project makes special is the huge understanding of international youth work and the needs of youth workers to support young people in the digital world that we can share with you. We have the ability to develop residential trainings for youth workers from all kind of countries and have done an international research about digital literacy of young people, using the Digcom 2.1 Framework. What we need are examples of how to train digital competences to youth workers, specificly the problem solving competence. We want to increase the lifelong learning competences of youth workers. 

The outcome of the project will be that we will have a training for youth workers that will support to increase their digital competenties and habits, so they will connect easier online with young people and can issue open badges to the young people they work with.
